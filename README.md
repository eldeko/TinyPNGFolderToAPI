### (Discontinued)

This is a small desktop program for batch optimizing images.
It uses the (wonderful) wrapper by Chad Tolkien (https://github.com/ctolkien/TinyPNG).
Neither this or Tolkien's project are affiliated to TinyPNG.com

WARNING:
Super alpha version. Some features still not working.
Use with caution.
